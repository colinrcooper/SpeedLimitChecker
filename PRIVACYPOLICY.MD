## Information We Use

### Location Data
The app uses **precise location data** from your device in order to:
- Calculate your current speed
- Retrieve nearby road speed limits from map data providers

Location data is processed **in real time on your device**.

---

## How Information Is Used
Location data is used solely to provide the app’s core functionality:
- Displaying current speed
- Displaying nearby speed limits

## Data Storage and Sharing

Cached data never contains personally identifiable information.
